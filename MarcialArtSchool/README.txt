This project is a Martial Art School Management System currently under development. 
It is designed to streamline the management of pupils, accounts, and other administrative tasks for martial art schools.
Built using Razor Pages in .NET 8, the system incorporates features such as user authentication, pupil registration, and data management through a repository pattern. 
The project is in its early stages, with ongoing work on key functionalities like login, registration, and database integration using Dapper.
